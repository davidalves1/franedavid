The Tagettes fonts are the type of Italian chancery writing of the 16th and 17th century that is mostly called Cancellaresca, and were developped out of a page of samples created by the French writing master Louis Barbedor around 1650.

Both fonts are matching -- on my computer at least --, and you should therefore have no difficulties in getting your texts  to look more swashed by selecting some letters and having them displayed as the alternate glyphs.

As usual, there is no number sign in these fonts, and you'll find a long s in its place.

Despite the alternate font, there are still extras in the Tagettes main font, e.g.

- a double l on the left bracket
- a double f on the right bracket
- a less swashed simple g on the bar sign
- an alternate r on the masculine ordinator, the 'less than or equal to', and the the 'fi' sign
- an alternate s on the feminine ordinator, the 'greater than or equal to', and the the 'fl' sign
- a swash on the underscore
- a swash on the ASCII tilde
- and yet another swash on the broken bar sign

TagettesPlus 
contains neither figures nor punctuation marks, nor composite charcters, and its set of upper case glyphs is identical with that of the main font. Its lower case letters are the alternate ones. They are mostly swashed, but you'll find a simple f and g there, too, as well as two less space-taking ys.

UPDATE 2007
has somwhat altered the TagettesPlus font, adding a swash to the c, s and v, changing the e and t, and redistributing some of the keys. Here's the actual list:

- a swashed long s on the number sign
- a new ending swash for middle zone characters on the period sign
- a swash on the hyphen
- another swash on the underscore
- the font's former e, s, and t on the numbers 1 to 3
- a second simple y on the number 4
- and an alternate German sharp s on the sharp s sign.
- As to the dragon, you'll find it now, not only on the @ sign, but on the µ (micro sign), too.

For the Tagettes main font, there has been a more thorough UPDATE in 2010, redesigning a lot of the composite glyphs, and eliminating some glitches which affected their boundaries (for example the yacute).
